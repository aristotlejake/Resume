    <p>I have always been intrigued by technology and the vast assortment of devices that rely on computer science to function. My interest in bleeding edge devices guided me to the relatively new field of study known as digital forensics. 
        Dixie State University developed a digital forensics program which was one of the first of its kind; the DSU-Computer Crime Institute, throughout which I learned the fundamentals of hardware, file systems, data structures, operating systems, software, and networking principles.
        I also learned the legal processes and procedures of computer systems and cyber crime.</p>
    <p>After graduating, I applied that knowledge to a career in Information Technology where I quickly excelled to a leadership role and furthered my knowledge of computer systems in the modern enterprise.</p>
    <p>As the world has become intrinsically reliant on technology, I have shifted my focus to the reliability and security of information and am pursuing a career in the cyber security space. My interest is primarily in cloud computing platforms in enterprise environments. 
        I enjoy white hat penetration testing and am currently pursuing the CEH and CISSP certifications.</p>
